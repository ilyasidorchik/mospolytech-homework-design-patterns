# Design Patterns Learning

I implemented the 9 design patterns by using native mobile app programming language Kotlin.

There are 3 creational patterns:
- Factory,
- Singelton,
- Builder;

<br>

3 structural:
- Decorator,
- Adapter,
- Bridge;

<br>

and 3 behavioral:
- Strategy,
- Iterator,
- Observer.
